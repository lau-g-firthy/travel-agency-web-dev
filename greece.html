                Greece has the longest coastline in Europe and is the southernmost country in Europe. 
                The mainland has rugged mountains, forests, and lakes, but the country is well known for the thousands 
                of islands dotting the blue Aegean Sea to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Ionian Sea 
                to the west.

                With an endless coast bathed by the pristine waters of the Mediterranean, the country enjoys mild weather and 
                a long summer season when compared to other European destinations. Greece boasts unique and varied landscapes, 
                from picturesque seaside villages to mountain hamlets, and fantastic old towns.
